Hi, my name is Caleb, Caleb McKay.

I'm a Data Scientist, and I help people solve problems and predict outcomes using data.

My main objective in being a data scientist is to leverage technology and data to solve some of the worlds biggest problems.

But it wasn't always like that. It wasn't always sunshine and rainbows. It wasn't always peaches and cream.. A few years ago, everything was different, for me..

You see, about 10 years ago, I had a vision for the future. Something that's so grand and awe-inspring, that you'd have to see it to believe it. But I was stuck. I didn't have a way to encapsulate this vision. I didn't have a way to turn this idea into reality. So I did what I thought I could - model, and not the modeling you'd do for catalogues. I tried to model what others have done before me. I tried to stand on the shoulders of giants.

So, for the next decade I collectively spent the majority of my time contacting high level thought leaders, in the world of business, aerospace, and tech. I learnt more in 3 years than I have in the previous 12. *But soon my fortune would come to an end.*

I went into a spiralling depression, was kicked out of my home, and forced to eat what I could, just to survive. But I couldn't let it end there. I couldn't let everything I've done up to this point go to waste. I knew that in order to fulfill this vision, I needed more.

I ended up partnering with a friend from college. We set off on creating a business that helped people in the State of Michigan recieve renewed appliances at an affordable price. It was a success. We were helping so many people and we had such an abundance that I lost sight of the vision. Even though everything was going great, I knew there was more that I could do for society, so I decided to put the business on pause and venture out into the world again..

I joined Lambda School to dive head first into the world of Data Science. From self-driving cars to dynamic business insights for Fortune 500 Companies, I knew that Data Science was changing the world. 

Now, as a full-time student at Lambda School, I'm en route to fulfilling the vision I had 10 years ago. To being a catalyst in deep learning, creating the future, and changing the world. 

*Yours sincerely,*
Caleb.
