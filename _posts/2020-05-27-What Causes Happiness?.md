# What Causes Happiness?

    The World Happiness Report is a survey conducted around the globe which asks individuals to rate their overall happiness on a scale of 1-10 and also asks what factors contribute to their happiness the most, which is then averaged out and grouped by country and region. In the dataset I recieved from Kaggle they used 6 distinct factors: "Health, GDP / Economy, Family Support, Trust in Government, Freedom, and Generosity."

    By running a correlation matrix on the data from the World Happiness Report, between the years 2015 and 2019, we can see that GDP / Economy are highly correlated with happiness, followed very closely by Family Support and Health.

    As the Happiness Score increases, the impact of GDP, Family Support, and Health also increases. 

# Conclusion 

    In conclusion, the main contributing factors to happiness appear to be GDP / Economy, Family Support, and Health. By having more money you essentially have the power to have more positive experiences in your life, and easily solve  stressful problems that ever occur. By having a family who supports you, you can be yourself, and feel love and share experiences with people you care about, and who care about you. And by having health, you'll be able to experience life at the highest level, without worry, and just do the things you love with confidence, clarity, and conviction.
