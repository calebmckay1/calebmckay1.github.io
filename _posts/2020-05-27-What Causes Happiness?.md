# What Causes Happiness?

&ensp; &ensp; The World Happiness Report is a survey conducted around the globe which asks individuals to rate their overall happiness on a scale of 1-10 and also asks what factors contribute to their happiness the most, which is then averaged out and grouped by country and region. In the dataset I recieved from Kaggle they used 6 distinct factors: "Health, GDP / Economy, Family Support, Trust in Government, Freedom, and Generosity."

&ensp; &ensp; It appears that the happiest regions reside in Australia / New Zealand, and North America, followed by Western Europe and Latin America, where the least happiest region seems to be Africa. It also appears that happiness doesnt change much from year to year. Lets get a closer look based on country now.

&ensp; &ensp; As you can see from the map, in 2019 the countries which reported to be the least happy reside in 3rd world countries, which leads us into in interesting question..


# Can Money Really Buy Happiness..? Well, sort of..

&ensp; &ensp; By running a correlation matrix on the data from the World Happiness Report, between the years 2015 and 2019, we can see that GDP / Economy are highly correlated with happiness, followed very closely by Family Support and Health.

&ensp; &ensp; As the Happiness Score increases, the impact of GDP, Family Support, and Health also increases. 

# Conclusion 

&ensp; &ensp; In conclusion, the main contributing factors to happiness appear to be GDP / Economy, Family Support, and Health. By having more money you essentially have the power to have more positive experiences in your life, and easily solve  stressful problems that ever occur. By having a family who supports you, you can be yourself, and feel love and share experiences with people you care about, and who care about you. And by having health, you'll be able to experience life at the highest level, without worry, and just do the things you love with confidence, clarity, and conviction.
